-Use reallife situations such as bread slices or pie slices
-Implement the new model suchas as 1/2 * 3/4 


I came home 1/2 of loaf of bread on cornter and made a sandwich with 3/4 of it. What fraction of the loaf did I use?
Use rectangles to represent bread do not curve corners. Use anything with with rectangular and squarish shapes. Do not use 
circles at lower levels for now. Fine for 5th grade and beyond
